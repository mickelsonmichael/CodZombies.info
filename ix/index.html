            Once the Champion is dead, you must pick up its head.

        <p>
            Directly after spawning into the map, you should proceed to begin these God Challenges.
            You must complete at least three in order to unlock the acid trap.
        </p>

        <p>
            In order to begin the challenges, go to the entrance of one of the God Towers in the arena and 
            <a data-fancybox href="images/challenges/bowl.JPG">locate the banner there.</a>
            Knifing the rope next to the banner will assign the player to that God and begin the challenges.

        <p>
            Every time you complete a challenge, a reward will be spawned into your God's Bowl on the platform in the
            center of the arena.
            For each of the Power Ups, they will spawn on the ground next to the pedastal after interacting with the

    <!-- Acid Trap -->
    <section id="acid_trap" class="container bg-light border border-success rounded px-4 py-3 mb-3">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
                <h2 class="border-bottom">Acid Trap</h2>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            The acid trap is a buildable trap that is used for several different Easter Egg sections.
            There are three components that must be picked up.
        </p>

        <p>
            The three parts are always in the same locations:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Chain
                <ul>
                    <li>Hanging off of a torch in the lower section of the Temple.</li>
                    <li><em>Note: You do not need to unlock the Pack-a-Punch to retrieve this item, only open the
                            Temple.</em></li>
                    <li>This component is found on the opposite side from the Gear</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Gear
                <ul>
                    <li>Sitting on the floor against a wall in the lower section of the Temple.</li>
                    <li><em>Note: You do not need to unlock the Pack-a-Punch to retrieve this item, only open the
                            Temple.</em></li>
                    <li>This component is found on the opposite side from the Chain</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Bowl
                <ul>
                    <li>On top of the pedastal in the center of the Arena</li>
                    <li>You <em>must</em> complete three God Challenges in order for this component to appear.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            With all three pieces, you simply must go to one of the three Acid Trap locations and build the trap
            (similar to building the shield).
        </p>

        <h3>Trap Locations:</h3>
        <ul>

            <li>Zues Tower: On the stairs between the top floor and ground floor.</li>
            <li>Odin Tower: On the stiars between the top floor and ground floor.</li>
            <li>Ra Tower: The path between the ground floor of the tower and the Arena.</li>
            <li>Danu Tower: The path between the ground floor of the tower and the Arena.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Death of Orion -->
    <section id="death_of_orion" class="container bg-light border border-danger rounded px-4 py-3 mb-3">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
                <h2 class="border-bottom">Death of Orion</h2>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            The Death of Orion is IX's unique wonder weapon.
            It can be Pack-a-Punched once and is used for multiple Easter Egg steps and challnges.
            It's unique design is simply a live scorpion sitting on top of a handle.
            When Pack-a-Punched and after charging the bullet before firing, it can hold a group of zombies in place
            and do some damage.
            This effect works on Mini-Bosses as well including Blightfathers and Gladiators.
        </p>

        <p>
            You may retrieve a free Death of Orion by completing the following steps or try your luck at the Mystery
            Box.
        </p>

        <h3>Guaranteed Aquisition</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                One you open the Pack-a-Punch, you must move to the Danu-Ra Temple Entrance.
                There you will find a curmbled wall with a fallen portcullis.
                On the other side you should be able to see a large, flaming bowl.
                You must simply shoot the bowl to move to the next step.
            </li>

            <li>
                Next, go to the bridge connecting the top floors of Ra and Danu and look down towards the arena to see
                a fire.
                The fire will be pointing towards one of the foor towers.
            </li>

            <li>
                Go to the tower the flames pointed towards and find a statue head.
                You can only pick up the statue head once you have reached this point.
                See the list of locations below for help finding the head.
            </li>

            
            <li>
                With head in hand, build the <a href="#acid_trap">Acid Trap</a> and place the head on the grate below
                it.
                Activate the trap and wait until it has finished pouring.
                Pick up the Spile left remaining.
            </li>

            <li>
                The next step requires you to maintain full Crowd Affinity for an entire round
                    (<em><a href="#death_of_orion__affinity">For more information, see the Affinity section below.</a></em>).
                After surviving the round, you will hear the announcer mention a gift and a small jar will appear on the ground, which you must pick up.
            </li>

            <li>
                Take the Jar into Danu's Tower bottom floor.
                The right tree (when entering from the Arena) will have a small hole in it facing the other tree.
                Melee it to place the spile into the hole.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a data-fancybox href="images/deathoforion/tree_hole.png">

            </li>

            <li>
                Place the jar below the spile where the sap is flowing.
            </li>

            
            <li>
                At the end of the current round, the jar will be "full" and can be picked up again.
            </li>

            <li>
                Take the jar of poison to the Mystery Box.
                Look at the 
                <a data-fancybox href="images/deathoforion/box_poison.jpg">
                    front left corner of the box
                </a>
                until the "Posion" prompt appears.
                Once poisoned, the box will turn a green color.
            </li>

            <li>
                The next weapon received out of the Mystery Box will be a Death of Orion.
                Any player can use the box, not just the player who poisoned it, and anyone can pay for it and share the weapon.
