            There are four sub-quests you must complete <strong>in a particular order</strong> to finish the first section of the main quest.

            Danu
        </h3>
    

        <h4>Collect the Ingredients</h4>

        <h5>Skull</h5>
        <p>
            Inside the temple, there are small walls of skulls throughout the area.
            One of these skulls will have a blue symbol on its head.
            While looking at the skull, you must activate your special weapon, then interact with it.
            If done correctly, the skull will pop out of the wall and can be picked up.
        </p>

        <p>
            Next you will need to take the skull and the <a href="#death_of_orion">Death of Orion</a> to the Flooded Crypts.
            A grinder will appear in one of severl locations in the Flooded Crypts.
            Place the skull inside of it and shoot the grinder with the <a href="#death_of_orion">Death of Orion</a>, fully charged, three times.
            Once completed, the skull will have been turned into bonemeal.
            Pick up the bonemeal to proceed.
        </p>

        <h5>Wood</h4>

        <p>
            Inside the main Arena will be two large pyres.
            You must lure a <a href="#enemy_gladiator">Gladiator</a> near one of the pyres and have them throw their axes through it.
            If done correctly a chunk of wood should fall off.
            Pick it up.
        </p>

        <p>
            Head to the basement of Odin Tower and look above the large cauldron in the center of the room.
            Interact with the cauldron to place the wood piece into one of the chains hanging from the ceiling.
            <b>Wait two rounds.</b>
            After two rounds, pick up the now burned wood.
        </p>

        <h5>Poo</h5>

        <p>
            In order to retrieve the poo, you must get <a href="#affinity__lowest">minimum Crowd Affinity.</a>
            Go to the arena with minimum Crowd Affinity and eventually the crowd will throw a pile of poop into the Arena.
            Simply run over to the pile to pick it up.
            You will take damage and lose points.
        </p>

        <h4>
            Mix the Ingredients
        </h4>

        <p>
            With all three ingredients in hand, proceed to the basement of Zeus tower.
            Next to the Blood Bath, there will be a large bowl on a counter.
            Interact with the bowl to place the three ingredients inside.
        </p>

        <p>
            Wait 2 rounds.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once the ingredients are fully mixed, the resulting mixture will have a green gas cloud above it.
            Pick up the mixture.
        </p>

        <h4>
            Open the Portal
        </h4>

        <p>
            Take the mixture to the basement of Danu Tower and place it between the trunks of the two trees.
        </p>

        <p>
            Wait 2 rounds.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once the mixture is ready, it will begin giving off the green gas cloud again.
            Lure a zombie over the mixture and kill it with a gun upgraded with <b>Fire Bomb</b> to cause a small explosion.
            Once done, there will be large blue cracks in the ground where the mixture once sat.
        </p>

        <p>
            Have all players stand on the crack for several seconds.
            Eventually the players will be transported to a new instance of Danu Tower.
        </p>

        <h4>Kill the Red Sacs</h4>

        <p>
            All players should look up to the tree and begin shooting the cluster of red sacs.
            Once all four sacs are popped, a free <strong>Max Ammo</strong> will appear and the staircase to the next floor will be opened.
        </p>

        <p>Repeat this process twice more on the ground and top floors to complete Danu's quest.</p>


        <h3 class="border-bottom border-white">
            Ra
        </h3>

        <p>
            Once Danu has been completed, four bull heads will appear in one of several random locations across the map.
            You must shoot each of these heads with the <a href="#shield">Brazen Bull</a> to summon a <a href="#enemy_gladiator">Gladiator</a>.
            Kill each of these <a href="#enemy_gladiator">Gladiators</a> and then proceed to the top floor of Ra Tower.
        </p>

        <p>
            The black Obelisk in the center of the room will now have a blue symbol etched into it.
            All the players must interact with the symbol to be transported to a new instance of Ra Tower.
        </p>

        <p>
            Next, you will need to <strong>watch the obelisk and remember the four symbols that appear</strong> and which order they appear in.
            Each symbol corresponds with a <a href="#enemies">Special Enemy</a>.
            You must kill each of these enemies <strong>in the order that their symbols appeared on the Obelisk</strong>.
            If you kill an enemy out of order, you will be removed from the instance, and must finish the round before being allowed to try again.
        </p>

        <p>
            This challenge must be completed <strong>twice</strong>.

            Zeus
        </h3>

        <p>
            After Ra has been completed, a symbol will appear on the pedastal in the center of the Challenge platform.
            When all four players interact with the symbol, they will be teleported to a new instance of the Temple/Crypts.
        </p>

        <p>
            Four poles will spawn within several windows near each of the four temples.
            Shooting these poles will cause them to rise up towards the ceiling.
            Once all four poles have been shot, proceed to the Arena.
        </p>

        <p>
            The four poles can be found on the edges of the Arena near each of the temples.
            A blue ring can be found on the ground encircling a pole.
            You must kill enough enemies in the ring using the Kill-O-Watt Pack-a-Punch effect for the pole to become charged.
        </p>

        <p>
            When a pole is fully charged, one of the Challenge Bowls in the center of the arena will be brightly lit.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once all four poles have been lit, you will be given an unlimited specialist weapon and need to survive an onslaught of Gladiators and Brawlers.
        </p>

        <h3 class="border-bottom border-white">
            Odin
        </h3>

        <p>
            Once the unlimited specialist weapon round has been survived, nine blue symbols will spawn in the lower section of the map.
            You must use the <a href="#death_of_orion">Death of Orion</a> to shoot each of these symbols at a particular angle.
            If shot properly, the symbol will remain illuminated.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once all nine symbols are lit, proceed to The Pit next to the <a href="#shield">Brazen Bull</a>.
            Have all players stand on the grating nearby for ~20 seconds.
            You will be teleported to a new instance of The Pit and must survive multiple waves.
        </p>

        <p>
            After surviving, you will be able to return to the normal map and a red portal will have appeared within the Arena.
        </p>

            Boss Fight
        </h3>

        <p>
            After surviving several special infected attacks, a large elephant will spawn.
            Shoot the armor on its sides to destory it.
            Once the armor is removed, attack the elephant's head to finish it off.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once the first elephant is defeated, a second will appear out of the other large gate.
            Kill this elephant in the <em>same way</em> to complete the bossfight and finish the Main Quest.

        </div>

        <p>
            The acid trap is a buildable trap that is used for several different Easter Egg sections.
            There are three components that must be picked up.
        </p>

        <p>
            The three parts are always in the same locations:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Chain
                <ul>
                    <li>Hanging off of a torch in the lower section of the Temple.</li>
                    <li><em>Note: You do not need to unlock the Pack-a-Punch to retrieve this item, only open the
                            Temple.</em></li>
                    <li>This component is found on the opposite side from the Gear</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Gear
                <ul>
                    <li>Sitting on the floor against a wall in the lower section of the Temple.</li>
                    <li><em>Note: You do not need to unlock the Pack-a-Punch to retrieve this item, only open the
                            Temple.</em></li>
                    <li>This component is found on the opposite side from the Chain</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Bowl
                <ul>
                    <li>On top of the pedastal in the center of the Arena</li>
                    <li>You <em>must</em> complete three God Challenges in order for this component to appear.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            With all three pieces, you simply must go to one of the three Acid Trap locations and build the trap
            (similar to building the shield).
        </p>

        <h3>Trap Locations:</h3>
        <ul>

            <li>Zues Tower: On the stairs between the top floor and ground floor.</li>
            <li>Odin Tower: On the stiars between the top floor and ground floor.</li>
            <li>Ra Tower: The path between the ground floor of the tower and the Arena.</li>
            <li>Danu Tower: The path between the ground floor of the tower and the Arena.</li>

    <!-- Death of Orion -->
    <section id="death_of_orion" class="container bg-light border border-danger rounded px-4 py-3 mb-3">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
                <h2 class="border-bottom">Death of Orion</h2>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            The Death of Orion is IX's unique wonder weapon.
            It can be Pack-a-Punched once and is used for multiple Easter Egg steps and challnges.
            It's unique design is simply a live scorpion sitting on top of a handle.
            When Pack-a-Punched and after charging the bullet before firing, it can hold a group of zombies in place
            and do some damage.
            This effect works on Mini-Bosses as well including Blightfathers and Gladiators.
        </p>

        <p>
            You may retrieve a free Death of Orion by completing the following steps or try your luck at the Mystery
            Box.
        </p>

        <h3>Guaranteed Aquisition</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                One you open the Pack-a-Punch, you must move to the Danu-Ra Temple Entrance.
                There you will find a curmbled wall with a fallen portcullis.
                On the other side you should be able to see a large, flaming bowl.
                You must simply shoot the bowl to move to the next step.
            </li>

            <li>
                Next, go to the bridge connecting the top floors of Ra and Danu and look down towards the arena to see
                a fire.
                The fire will be pointing towards one of the foor towers.
            </li>

            <li>
                Go to the tower the flames pointed towards and find a statue head.
                You can only pick up the statue head once you have reached this point.
                See the list of locations below for help finding the head.
            </li>

            
            <li>
                With head in hand, build the <a href="#acid_trap">Acid Trap</a> and place the head on the grate below
                it.
                Activate the trap and wait until it has finished pouring.
                Pick up the Spile left remaining.
            </li>

            <li>
                The next step requires you to maintain full Crowd Affinity for an entire round
                    (<em><a href="#death_of_orion__affinity">For more information, see the Affinity section below.</a></em>).
                After surviving the round, you will hear the announcer mention a gift and a small jar will appear on the ground, which you must pick up.
            </li>

            <li>
                Take the Jar into Danu's Tower bottom floor.
                The right tree (when entering from the Arena) will have a small hole in it facing the other tree.
                Melee it to place the spile into the hole.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a data-fancybox href="images/deathoforion/tree_hole.png">

            </li>

            <li>
                Place the jar below the spile where the sap is flowing.
            </li>

            
            <li>
                At the end of the current round, the jar will be "full" and can be picked up again.
            </li>

            <li>
                Take the jar of poison to the Mystery Box.
                Look at the 
                <a data-fancybox href="images/deathoforion/box_poison.jpg">
                    front left corner of the box
                </a>
                until the "Posion" prompt appears.
                Once poisoned, the box will turn a green color.
            </li>

            <li>
                The next weapon received out of the Mystery Box will be a Death of Orion.
                Any player can use the box, not just the player who poisoned it, and anyone can pay for it and share the weapon.
